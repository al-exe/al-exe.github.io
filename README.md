## Description
Colony Clicker is a React web application used to assist in MMEJ (microhomology-mediated end joining) research. It was built as a successor to [Colony Counter](https://github.com/al-exe/colony-counter), which ambitiously attempted to automate the counting process entirely.

*Colonies labelled with red numbers.*

## Basic usage
1. Go here: [Colony Clicker](https://al-exe.github.io/).
2. Upload a `.png` or `.jpg` file for labelling. 
3. Click anywhere within the image to create a label.
4. Screenshot your finished work, otherwise it will be lost.
5. Press `Discard image` in the right hand side to begin labelling the next image.

#### Usage tips
* To undo your last created label, press `ctrl + z` or `command + z`.
* Adjust your label settings (label type, color, size) in the right hand side.

## Data policy
Images uploaded to Colony Clicker and modifications made will not be saved anywhere. No user or usage data is collected.

## Limitations
Nothing. AI implemented everything I had in this list...

## Future
These are some things that may be supported in the future.
- **Labelling accuracy:** Allow users to tweak `(x, y)` coordinates offsets for increased accuracy.
- **Native screenshotting:** Allow users to download the labelled image.
